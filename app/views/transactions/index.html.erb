<h1>KelloggCoin Ledger</h1>

<!-- Step 1: List all transactions, starting with the ICO -->


<!-- Create an ordered list (`ol`) with each list item (`li`) displaying the details of each of the 100 transactions
 If the transaction is anything but the "Initial Coin Offering", i.e. the `from_user` of the `Transaction` exists (you can test this condition with something like `if from_user`), then display the details of the transaction (e.g. *1557 KC from Ben to Brian*)
 If the transaction is the "Initial Coin Offering", then display it as such (e.g. *Initial coin offering: 10000 to Ben*)-->

<% transactions = Transaction.all>

<ul>

<% for t in transactions %>

<li> 

  <%= t["from_user_id"] %>
  <%= t["to_user_id"] %>
  <%= t["amount"] %>

  <li> 

    <% end %>

<!-- Step 2: Calculate and display the balances -->

<!-- balance = sum of all transactions received minus sum of all transactions undertaken
for every user -->

<% users = User.all %>

<ul>

<% for u in users %>
<li>
<%= u["name"]%>
<% income = Transaction.find_by "from_user_id" => t["id"]%>
<% expense = Transaction.find_by "to_user_id" => t["id"]%>


</li>
<% end %>

</ul>


<!-- 
Expected balances:
Balance for Brian: 1348 KC
Balance for Ben: 2516 KC
Balance for Evan: 1164 KC
Balance for Anthony: 1456 KC
Balance for Krystina: 3516 KC
